# Salesforce-AngularJS-Boilerplate
## An AngularJS SPA Application Boilerplate for Salesforce Developer
### Concept 
To develop Salesforce in the moderm web development - SPA. 
Run fast, efficiently. No reload at all.
In the [Router Example Guide](https://github.com/TheRemjx01/salesforce-ngJS-boilerplate/tree/router-example) we have already covered how to integrate `ui-router` to be able to navigate between pages of our SPA Application without reload anything at all. 

In this chapter, we will add `ng-material` as our UI Library and demo a few `Remote Action` that integrated with `SOQL` as well as `Salesforce Object`.
Why `ng-material`? Because currently , the most popular UI Library in Salesforce is `Lightning Design System(SLDS)`. However `SLDS` is only CSS Framework.
Actually, we don't want to rewrite all the date-picker, custom table, other ui component again.
 So we need a UI Framework in `angularJS` to develop faster and efficiently!.
 
 In this example, i will create a todos-app.
